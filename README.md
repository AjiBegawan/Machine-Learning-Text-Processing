# Text Maestro: 25+ Supervised Learning Projects for NLP Exploration

Explore my journey into natural language processing through 25+ text processing projects using DNN, LSTM, GRU, and RNN models. Datasets sourced from Kaggle and beyond. âœ¨ Inspired by brilliant minds like [Aman Kharwal](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/) and countless [Medium](https://medium.com/) articles, I craft projects that blend code and language to solve fascinating problems.

## Beyond the code, I yearn to:

- Contribute my skills: I'm a team player eager to learn from experienced mentors and collaborate on impactful projects.
- Make a difference: My passion for text and AI compels me to tackle real-world problems and leave a positive mark.
